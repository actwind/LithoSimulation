# LithoSimulation
Litho Simulation, to implement lithography model and algorithm described in textbooks or papers.

1. Objectives in Near future:

  1) Providing capabiltiy of Parsing GDSII file, also adding notes or instructions on GDSii format
      ---- Parse GDS file to ASCii (done)
      ---- Parse boundry type of GDS file to mask 
      ---- ....
      
  Build Mask by polygons
  
  Foward simulation of Lithography process
  
  

2. Source of Models and Algorithms:

1) Optical and Other Models:

Fundermental of Lithography, Chris Mack

Resolution Enhancement Techniques in Optical Lithography, Alfred Wong
